# ClickCounter-Mobile-App

### A simple mobile application built using react-native.

The idea is simple. You set a timer for the number of seconds you want (e.g. 10 seconds) and start clicking in the container that pops up. The app counts the number of clicks you can make for 10 seconds.
  
Configuration files for the react-native project are intentionally ommited. Only the javascript source code is committed.
